# Prompt-Engineering-In-Context-Learning

## Write-Up

The .pdf writeup contains the problems and associated outputs (relevant aspects), comments, and analysis. 
Since the writeup is extremely long as is, we included our .ipynb file which contains all of our used prompts and raw output. It is well-labeled, and there is a variable that can be changed depending on which model you would like to use.
